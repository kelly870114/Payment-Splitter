# Payment Splitter

Due to the widespread use of cryptocurrencies, many people are building NFTs or DeFi projects together, and they will need a safe and reliable way to split the crypto profits. Hence, for this project, we aim to develop a crypto asset splitter application for users to keep track of their shared crypto transactions. We are using Swift for our frontend, Node.js for our backend, and Solidity for smart contracts, along with other tools such as Truffle, Ganache-CLI, MongoDB.
